# Kaahal timelines
A simple application to create and compare timelines.

## Why this thing?
Whenever you have to work with a chronology of events, a timeline is the tool
to choose, particularly in the fields of history, archaeology, geology and so
on.

A timeline application that is easy to use, could be a very useful tool to
compare different history theories, thus the motivation for writting this
piece of software.

## So whatâ€™s going on here?
Well, this may take a while to be fully developed but as soon as the first
release of the application is ready, the users should be able to create, 
display and compare timelines generated by the users themselves.

A timeline is always public so there are not really access rights, all 
timelines should be displayed on a easy to use table to consult and
compare.
